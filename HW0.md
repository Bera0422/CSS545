1. Intended Platform: Primarily **Android**.
2. Intended Framework/Programming Language: **Kotlin**
3. Cross-Platform Development: I want to consider cross-platform development using frameworks such as **Flutter**.
4. Brief Explanation: 
* I chose Android due to its large user base and my prior experience with it.
* Kotlin is concise and officially supported for Android. It seems like the optimal choice.
* Support for cross-platform is cruical to reach a wide customer audience. Using a cross-platform development framework such as Flutter allows deployment on both Android and iOS and makes the development process much easier.
* My primary focus will be on Android and Kotlin because of familiarity and ease of use. Cross-platform development might be explored depending on the scope and timeline of the project.
