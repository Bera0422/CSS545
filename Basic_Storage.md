# Various Approaches to Storage Management in React Native

## 1. Key-Value Storage (AsyncStorage)

A simple key-value storage system that comes as a built-in library in React Native. It’s typically used for storing small amounts of data such as user settings, preferences, and session information.

**Pros**:
- Ideal for small, lightweight data such as user preferences and settings.
- Comes natively with React Native, so no need for additional setup.
- Works on both iOS and Android without additional code.

**Cons**:
- Not suited for large amounts of data and has performance limitations if the data grows.
- Can only store and retrieve data by key, making it inefficient for structured or relational data.

**For WalkWays**:  
Perfect for storing user settings like preferred routes, themes, or notification settings. However, it’s not appropriate for storing large or complex data.

## 2. File Storage (react-native-fs)

File-based storage allows for storing larger files such as images, videos, music, or documents. This is achieved by saving files directly to the device's file system.

**Pros**:
- Handles large files such as images, videos, and music efficiently.
- Files are stored locally, making them accessible even when offline.
- Can store any file format (e.g., JSON, images).

**Cons**:
- Responsibility for managing the file system, including handling file names, paths, and cleaning up unused files, falls on the developer.
- Not ideal for relational or structured data; it’s better for storing files than for querying data.

**For WalkWays**:  
Best suited for storing media like route maps or user-uploaded photos, especially for caching purposes.

## 3. Relational Database (SQLite)

A structured, relational database that can handle complex data storage, such as multiple related tables. SQLite offers SQL querying capabilities, which allows for efficiently managing structured data such as user-generated routes or interaction logs. 

**Pros**:
- Ideal for complex data structures or when relational data storage is needed, such as walking routes with associated metadata.
- Can efficiently query and filter data using SQL, which is perfect for handling lists of routes or user data.

**Cons**:
- Requires more setup and management than simpler storage methods, especially when working with migrations or multiple tables.
- Though powerful, SQLite is still bound by local storage constraints and might not be suitable for very large datasets.

**For WalkWays**:  
Excellent for storing route history or any structured data that needs efficient querying. However, it might be overkill for storing simple key-value pairs like preferences.

## 4. Document Storage (Realm)

A NoSQL-based database optimized for mobile devices. Realm allows for storing data in objects rather than tables, making it easy to work with more complex or dynamic data structures.

**Pros**:
- Stores data as objects (documents), making it easy to manage without the rigid structure of a relational database.
- Built-in synchronization for apps that require syncing with a cloud server.
- Realm is highly performant, particularly with large datasets or frequently updated data.

**Cons**:
- Overkill for simple use cases like user preferences or basic media storage.
- Requires third-party library installation and setup.

**For WalkWays**:  
If WalkWays was heavily dependent on object-based storage and would benefit from cloud syncing, Realm could be a good choice. However, it’s more complex than necessary for this project’s current requirements.

## 5. Cloud Storage (Firebase, AWS S3)

Cloud-based storage options allow for storing data on external servers, which is ideal for sharing between devices or backing up large files. It is a good choice for storing user-generated content (e.g., photos, videos) or backing up application data for future use across multiple devices.

**Pros**:
- Allows storage of large files and backups in the cloud, making them accessible from multiple devices.
- Data isn’t constrained by the device's storage capacity.
- Ideal for keeping user data safe and synchronized across devices.

**Cons**:
- An internet connection is required to access or store data, which limits offline functionality.
- Requires more setup, including handling authentication and security rules.

**For WalkWays**:  
Cloud storage might become necessary for storing user-generated content across multiple devices and ensuring data security. It could also be used to enhance existing routes and suggest new ones based on collected data.
